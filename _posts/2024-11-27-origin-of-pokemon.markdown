The Pokémon franchise, one of the most successful in history, was born from the childhood passion of its creator, Satoshi Tajiri. Growing up in rural Japan, Tajiri loved collecting bugs, a hobby that inspired the concept of capturing and trading creatures. His fascination with exploring nature and discovering unique insects became the foundation for Pokémon, which encourages players to "catch 'em all" and become Pokémon trainers.
