The term "bug" in programming has an amusing origin. In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer discovered a moth trapped in a relay, causing the system to malfunction. They removed the moth, taped it into their logbook, and humorously noted they were "debugging" the system. This literal bug became the symbolic start of a term that programmers now use daily to describe and resolve software issues.
