[Ada Lovelace][ada-lovelace], a mathematician from the 19th century, is widely celebrated as the world’s first computer programmer. Working alongside Charles Babbage, she designed algorithms for his proposed Analytical Engine, a precursor to modern computers. What’s remarkable is that Ada foresaw the potential of computers to go beyond mere number crunching, envisioning their use in tasks like composing music. Her contributions are now celebrated annually on Ada Lovelace Day, a tribute to her pioneering role in the history of computing and programming.
