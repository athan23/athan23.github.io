In 1969, NASAâ€™s [Apollo 11][apollo-11] mission used onboard computers with just 4KB of RAM to land humans on the moon. Today, the smartphone in your pocket has millions of times that power, capable of running complex apps, high-definition video, and AI models. This incredible leap in computing power illustrates the relentless progress driven by software engineering and hardware innovation over the decades.
