Hi, I’m Jonathan, a software engineer specializing in backend development and scalable systems. When I’m not writing clean, efficient code, you’ll probably find me tinkering with side projects or exploring the latest tech trends.

Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in creating robust APIs, optimizing database performance, and building systems that scale. I’ve worked on multiple projects ranging from a live streaming platform and a payment service system, and I love collaborating with teams to bring innovative ideas to life.

Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active and challenging myself physically. I partake in caslithenics exercises to build strength and agility. I also enjoy playing badminton. And when it's time to unwind, I'll be playing video games in my comfy room!

I’m always excited to connect with like-minded folks who share a passion for technology. Whether you want to chat about a project, brainstorm ideas, or simply say hello, feel free to reach out!
